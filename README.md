# ❓ What is it?
Leverage invocation of **C# events** from `PlayerInput` without pain and boilerplate code!

This package gives you the "service" that acts like a event-bus for input actions:
*	Just drop a pre-built component where your `PlayerInput` component is & assign a reference to special `InputSerivce` in the editor;
*	Register a method that should be executed when a certain `InputAction` happens with 2 lines of code in your class where you typically handle the input;

Simple as that!
